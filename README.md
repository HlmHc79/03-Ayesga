# 03-Ayesha-Layout
Third project. 

### Goals

After a bit of reading and tutorials viewing my goals for this layout:
- Build it Mobile first
- Use Semantic HTML
- Use BEM CSS naming
- Keep practicing Flexbox

The layout comes from [Ajmal khan on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/6872630-Ayesha-Hair-Salon-Template-Home-03)
You can see it deployed [here](https://ayesha-layout.netlify.app/)

### What I learned

- I had to figure out how to build a toggle navigation ( I used [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QKOaTYvYUA))
- I learned how to use Grid for the gallery ([this tutorial](https://learncssgrid.com/))
